## Hi there 👋

I'm an IT student based in India who enjoys coding solutions 🧑‍💻💡  
Currently working with the **MERN stack** on projects like **Data Sentinel** (data infiltration protection) and an **Encrypted File Organizer**.

I'm also exploring **Cloud Computing**, improving my **AI/ML** skills, and interested in contributing to **open source**.  
Passionate about **hackathons**, **team projects**, and clean **UI/UX** design.
